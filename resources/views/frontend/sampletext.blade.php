        <p>(Organization name) uses FlashAlert Newswire, an Internet-based system for distributing emergency changes in schedule (such as snow closures), and other news, to the news media and the public. </p>
        <p>Through FlashAlert Messenger, you  may self-register up to three email addresses. And if you download and install the FA Messenger app, receive news releases and emergency information via Push Notification on your iPhone or Android, moments after we post it, at no cost to you. </p>
        <p>To get started, go to <strong>FlashAlert.net</strong> and click on our region on the map. Choose our organization category and then our name. Start the subscription process by filling in your email address.</p>
        <p>After entering your email address(es), you will receive a validation message. Obtain the two-letter code in the message and post it back into your account to validate that address (or click on the provided link). This is done to make sure that your messages will reach you.</p>
        <p>Using the FA Messenger app is easy. After creating your account online, load/open the app and enter the email address and password and the app will link to it. The app may ask permission to send you Push Notifications. Thatâ€™s it. You will continue to make changes to your account (i.e. adding schools or orgs you want to hear from or changing an email address) through your online account.</p>
        <p><strong>ORGS: Please note that you can substiture the address of your specific FlashAlert home page (i.e. for Oregon State Police, <em>www.flashalert.net/id/OSPOre</em> ) in lieu of the third paragraph.</strong></p>
