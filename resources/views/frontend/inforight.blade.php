                <strong> When Your News Needs to be There in a Flash... </strong>
            </i>
        </p>
        <p align="left">
            <span size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">You've got breaking news</span>
            <span size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">to pass on to the news media in your area. You
                can call newsrooms with your
                info -- if you've got an hour -- or fax it to them -- and hope they see your
                fax mixed in with everything else. At certain times of the year, such as during
                a winter storm or after an earthquake, <i>everyone</i> is trying to reach stations
                and newspapers at the same time. Wouldn't it be better to be able to post your
                information in one place and have a system that passes it on immediately to
                all of the media and the public?</span>
        </p>

        <p>
            <span size="-1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">That's the principle behind FlashAlert
                Newswire. Each network region collects emergency information from a number of
                organizations in a specific media market and provides it to the media via a
                continuously updated website and by sending your info via e-mail to the newsrooms
                and <i>into the media’s own websites.</i>On FlashAlert, the media will find information about schedule
                changes and other
                urgent information from schools, colleges, law enforcement, businesses, hospitals,
                utilities, cities and more.</span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span color="#330099" class="txt-drk-blu">FlashAlert can help you with
                your everyday news releases,
                too. A second channel allows subscribers to dispatch regular news releases to
                stations and newspapers in the cities they choose. FlashAlert sends releases
                to the news media in electronic format, so they don't have to retype it. You
                can attach a photo or sound file or PDF. To keep your news release “alive” longer, they go into an archive
                webpage where they remain available to the media for one month.</span>

        <hr align="LEFT">
        <p class="txt-green">"With this system, all of the
            information is right in front of us, posted by the schools directly. It is automatically updated, organized
            logically and very easy to read. It speeds the information process at a time when time is of the essence. It
            eliminates steps in which mistakes can be made-- there are no telephone calls to answer, no illegible
            handwriting or fuzzy faxes to decipher. To top it off, the information is automatically incorporated into our
            station's web site, making it even more useful. FlashAlert is a miracle cure. I could go on and on about this,
            it's so cool."<br>

            sent my first FlashAlert release last week, I got a call from a Seattle radio station within 15 minutes. Bob,
            the president, gave him an interview the same day. How about that? This is SO easy! Where have you been all my
            life?"</p>
