                                such that they can stay on the news release page and instead of a scroll, they will get a
                                flashing link when there is an active emergency report.</p>
                            <p><strong>4/6/2018: Word Count.</strong> At the suggestion of a client, we added a word counter

                                the emergency posting page for those concerned about message length. And now, your logo

                            <p><strong>2/14/2017: Default delete time for schools now 5 pm.</strong> At the request of the

                                stations, we have pulled down the 7 pm default delete time for all-day messages to 5 pm.
                                Late-start messages still have an 11 am default delete. But now, if you change from a late

                                to closed for example, the system will automatically change your delete time from 11 am to 5
                                pm.
                                Non-schools will retain their default delete time of three hours after the posting time.</p>
                            <p><strong>11/16/16: Android app updated.</strong> We rolled out an update to the FlashAlert
                                Messenger app for Android to fix an issue created by an Android OS update earlier this year.
                                We
                                also found a setting that was off that should help iOS users link the app to their web
                                account.

                                Twitter pages. To access this feature, log in to your FlashAlert account with your Facebook
                                credentials on the login page, www.falogin.net</p>
                            <p><strong>6/18/16: URLs for individual news releases.</strong> You now can send a link to a
                                specific news release. The format is flashalert.net/id/xxxxx/yyyyy (with the xxxxx being

                                org’s shortcut name and yyyyy being the number on the top of the release when you look at it

                                it on.</p>
                            <p><strong>2/25/16: Add your logo.</strong> You now can have your org logo appear on your custom
                                page in FlashAlert, and on your emails to the media. On your account management page is a
                                new
                                upload field for your logo. Here’s what it (a badge) looks like on Portland Police’s page:

                            <p><strong>1/22/16: Android Messenger app.</strong> If your people get a message that they are
                                not
                                connected to the Internet, they should turn off wifi and use the app on cellular service.
                                Then
                                turn wifi back on, and they should be able to work off either network. The problem seems to
                                be a
                                conflict between the app and an Android operating system upgrade. We are working on an
                                update to
                                the app, but it requires a rebuild from the ground up.</p>
                            <p><strong>1/3/16: Message preview.</strong> The emergency posting page now has a preview field
                                so
                                you can see exactly how your message will appear to the media, in their websites and on
                                their
                                crawls.</p>
                            <p><strong>6/20/15: Faster servers.</strong> My ISP shifted the system to new, faster servers
                                over
                                the weekend. Any such move alwsays pops up some gremlins, but we think we’ve got that under
                                control.</p>
                            <p><strong>9/2/14: Phasing out of text messages.</strong> While emails to the public will
                                continue,
                                we are working to phase out text messages, in favor of push notifications through the
                                FlashAlert
                                Messenger app for iOS and Android. Text messages are a <em>major problem</em>, subject to

                                or deletion by the cell companies, as well as some companies cutting off messages at 160
                                characters. If someone simply <em>must</em> get a text message, they can enter their address
                                manually (i.e. <a href="mailto:8005551212@txt.att.net">8005551212@txt.att.net</a>)</p>
                            <p><strong>8/20/14: Better info page for news media.</strong> We revised the page that the news
                                media monitor so that they can see emergency postings on the news release archive page.
                                Everything they need in one place.</p>

                                can simplify your FlashAlert news page URL. So you have your choice of the default, i.e.,
                                flashalert.net/news.html?id=37 Or you can set: flashalert.net/id/mhcc</p>
                            <p>It could be the same one you use for Twitter or Facebook. Just remember that each

                                fixed the problem that was crashing the FlashAlert Editor app when you changed cities (see
                                11-2-13 entry below). Just remember that there are a few things you can do on the website
                                that
                                you can’t do on the app, such as use both the menus and the text field at the same time.</p>

                                studios in Portland February 26 to hear what they had to say about submitting news. Here are
                                audio files of that conversation, in two parts: <a

                            <p><strong>3/4/14: Better control of postings to Facebook/Twitter:</strong> When posting an
                                emergency message, you now can choose whether or not the postings is sent on to Facebook
                                and/or
                                Twitter (if you have linked your FlashAlert account to your FB or T accounts). The idea is
                                that
                                you may want to send something more detailed to your Messenger subscribers, then something
                                shorter to FB/T and the media.</p>
                            <p>If you posted a message and had it also go to FB or T, deleting your message will delete it
                                from
                                FB and/or T. If your message reaches its scheduled delete time, the FB/T posting(s) will
                                remain.

                            <p><strong>1/10/14: News release “Photo” notation and “Send Later.”</strong> When you attach a
                                photo
                                to a news release, <strong>(Photo)</strong> now automatically appears at the end of the
                                headline. The media is hungry for images so this helps them quickly find releases with a
                                graphic
                                element.</p>
                            <p>And you now can set a news release for <strong>future dispatch.</strong> Select a time (by
                                half
                                hour increments) and FlashAlert will distribute it then. Every day that you have a draft
                                waiting, FlashAlert will send an email reminder to your two contacts, at 9 am and 3 pm.</p>
                            <p><strong>1/3/14: Better text messages.</strong> Today, Josh worked over the text message
                                generator
                                and reduced the amount of superfluous information, such as a school district’s name showing
                                twice. This should get more info to the public in the 160 characters we are limited to.</p>
                            <p><strong>12/23/13: Use Quick Report menus AND the text field now. </strong>FlashAlert is
                                making a
                                change in the emergency/closure posting page that should help you assemble the best possible
                                weather closure message to the media and, if you are using the Messenger service, your
                                patrons.
                            </p>
                            <p>Whereas previously it was use one or the other, you now can build your message using BOTH the
                                Quick Report pre-formed messages AND/OR the custom message field below it. We are doing this
                                specifically to encourage everyone to use the Quick Report menus and then, if necessary,
                                enter
                                supplemental information into the Custom Report field. But please don’t put the same info
                                into
                                the text field as you put in the menus, and no need to type “Due to inclement weather…” if
                                it’s
                                snowing!</p>
                            <p><strong>11/15/13: Photos now in emails to media. </strong>Today we implemented another
                                goodie:
                                emails to the news media now are HTML. And if you include a photo(s) on a news release, the
                                first image now goes as a thumbnail on the news release email, along with the usual links to
                                the
                                others (if any). Therefore, lead with your best shot. Josh soon will add an automation such
                                that
                                whenever there is a photo, (Photo) will automatically appear at the end of the headline, to
                                save

                            <p><strong>11/2/13: iOS 7 Editor app bug. </strong>Today we discovered a glitch in how

                                Editor interacts with Apple’s iOS7. If you try to change your city selection in the app, it
                                crashes. In the meantime, you can log in to your org’s account on the web and set your

                                cities so that you don’t need to change them in the app.</p>

                                to the primary contact, the secondary or any other email address. Coming soon: Future Send,
                                where you choose a future delivery date/time. And don’t forget the draft option, where you
                                can
                                save a release to work on later or share with a colleague. To make sure it doesn’t slip
                                through
                                the cracks, FlashAlert will send you a daily noontime reminder if you have a draft on hold.

                                would pop up an orange alert page. Really annoying! Now, the page tab flashes “New

                                and it chimes an alert.</p>
                            <p><strong>1/17/13: Emergency messages faster than ever. </strong>FlashAlert has always sent
                                emergency messages on the quarter hour, since the system started with weather closures only.
                                I
                                didn’t want the media getting 60 emails an hour on snow days, just four consolidated ones.
                            </p>
                            <p>But that has meant emergency messages from ODOT, OSP, police and fire, etc., have had to live
                                by
                                the quarter-hour cycle, too. That changed this week with new programming that allows me to
                                toggle emergency message dispatch from every 15 minutes on snow days to immediate dispatch
                                the
                                rest of the year. (News releases have always been on immediate dispatch.) On average, the
                                media
                                should get your emergency items seven minutes faster.</p>
